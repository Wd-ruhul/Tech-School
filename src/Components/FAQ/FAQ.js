              What do Tech School courses include?
            </Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Body>
              Each course is created, owned and managed by the instructor(s).
              The foundation of each Tech School course are its lectures, which
              can include videos, slides, and text. In addition, instructors can
              add resources and various types of practice activities, as a way
              to enhance the learning experience of students.

              in your confirmation email (provided youâ€™re logged into your Tech
              School account). You can also begin the course by logging in and
              navigating to your Course Page.
